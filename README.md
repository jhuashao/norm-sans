# Norm

[![Sample](imgs/1.jpg)]()


Norm is a contemporary neo-grotesque sans-serif type family that blends monospace aesthetics with swiss-styled, geometric accents. 

Norm is divided into two styles: Norm Sans and Norm Mono.

The two styles informed each other's visual look and feel as they were being crafted, as proportional typefaces are different in construction from monospace ones. Norm Sans and Norm Mono were drawn simultaneously, as I worked back and forth between the two, all the while drawing inspiration from a variety of typefaces from both categories.

Similarly in which Space Mono by Colophon was constructed, Norm embraces the constraints of monospace typefaces, and forms its personality with nods towards contemporary, Helvetic, and geometric type design practices. 

Current font styles for Norm Sans:
