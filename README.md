Norm is a contemporary sans-serif type family that blends monospace functionality with modernist geometric accents. The spirit of this typeface is an attempt to create a bridge between computational and humanist traditions ‚Äî balancing and blending features from monospace and neo-grotesques type cultures.

## Features

### Design Details

Norm Sans is available in **7 weights** and **14 styles**, ready to use right out of the box. It works particularly well in display sizes, but can hold its own when set in body text.
